## What is it?

GitMoon is a Git UI for people who want to manage repositories without always being online. It's built with Electron and React, with a dark futuristic theme that's easy on the eyes.

## Key Features

- **Works offline** - Do everything without an internet connection. Push/pull when you're ready.
- **Branch comparison** - See what changed between branches with file-by-file diffs
- **Commit graph** - Visual representation of your git history
- **Automation scripts** - Create multi-step workflows for common tasks (merge, push, pull, etc.)
- **Clean interface** - Focus on what matters without the clutter

## Automation Scripts

Create custom workflows to automate repetitive git operations. For example:
- Switch to main → pull → switch to feature branch → merge main → push
- Daily sync across multiple branches
- Release preparation workflows

## Getting Started

**Requirements:** Node.js 18+, Git

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run in development mode
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## How It Works

GitMoon uses [dugite](https://github.com/desktop/dugite) (the same Git wrapper as GitHub Desktop) to interact with your repositories. Everything is stored locally using electron-store, so your data stays on your machine.
